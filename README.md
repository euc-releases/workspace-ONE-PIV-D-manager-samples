## Workspace ONE PIV-D Manager Samples
This repository provides code samples for integrating and leveraging features of the Workspace ONE PIV-D Manager application, facilitating its seamless integration with [iOS Workspace ONE PIV-D Manager application](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/piv-d-manager-workspace-one/id1225667504) and [Android Workspace ONE PIV-D Manager application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.workspaceone.pivd&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

Different sets of sample code will be published to this repository. At time of
writing, the following set is available.

## Sample CTK Consumer applicatiion for iOS
The [SamplePivdTokenApp](iOSPIVDSamples/SamplePivdTokenApp) is an iOS sample application that showcases how to use keys accessed via a Persistent Token Extension by including com.apple.token in the app's entitlements file. This sample app is designed to work in conjunction with CTK Provider apps like Workspace One PIV-D Manager application to demonstrate authenticate, sign, and decrypt operations.

## Certificate authority for testing purposes
The [ca-openssl-cli](ca-openssl-cli) directory has a certificate authority based on the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) command line called from Python. The authority can be used to generate electronic certificates for test and demonstration purposes.
